Do you know Mario? Haha, no jokes... ðŸ˜‚ We're here with a directory containing three games to make your Scrum Master meetings much more fun and interesting! We have the following games:


**Hangman Game**
Rules: You and your team try to guess the letters of the words, one by one. Whoever guesses the word chooses another person to say something related to the discovered word. For example, if the word is "anger," the person must say something that made them angry during this sprint.
##
**Meme Game**
Rules: Each participant chooses a card by pointing at it or saying its position. Upon revealing the card, they must explain what in the sprint reminds them of that meme (and can also mention if they should have done something about it). This game promotes more fun and conversation among the participants.
##
**Question Game**
Rules: Each participant selects a card and answers the question on it. The cards contain questions about both the sprint and personal topics to break the ice among the team.

Note: Feel free to modify the rules as you see fit.
